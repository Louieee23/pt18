Online game addiction is a serious illness that people all around the world is currently having. Even students are being addicted to mobile and computer games. An example would be DOTA 2, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang and many others. Their root causes would be because people need to relax and play some games after a log day at work another cause would be because friends and sometimes family members invites them to play. Then they start getting addicted to it and finally getting attached to the game. 
But what does the church have to say to this? Well, according to some sources playing video games is not sinful but it does affect lovelife, the attention you give to your loved ones, and sometimes your overall behaviour as a person. You lose opportunities of getting a job and a loving mate. There is also profanity which God which openly disagrees with “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man” (Matthew 15:11). 

The significance of the project aims to educate both youth and elders how much our screens affect our daily life especially about the addiction in online game addiction. A study by Sherry et al (2001) investigating the reasons for playing video and computer games by adolescents and their game priorities on 535 adolescents in age 15-20 in the West USA found that 68% of adolescents had these games as their weekly entertainment. The reasons for playing these games among boys were excitements and challenges and they insisted to win. The study of Carrasco (2001) stated that computers have become a part of man’s life. Almost all the things around us were made by computers with the aid of modern machines. Associated with the computers is the internet where we can find online games. Online games have big impact in the internet right now, its biggest influence mainly focused on teenagers who find online games addictive because of the games mechanism to attract and make its players feel exciting during gameplay. This such games that are popular in the internet right now are design and developed to able to drive away the boredom of teenagers by being able to adapt to the game and focus on the game's goals and more performance to attract its users to spend more time on their screens rather than being out in the internet. This makes online games a big entertainment in the internet. This project aims to educate how the internet especially online games can make someone have an addiction in a matter of minutes or hours, moreover the youth this days must watch out for devices and such parents should not put there children in a such young age in the internet. The danger of the internet for youth are highly large since they are exposed to random contents online that may affect their age perspective at a young age, internet might be available to everyone but i doesn't mean it is for everybody and people putting major risk on their exposure online especially their important details and credentials by posting innocent pictures but can be disguised at something a random person can track and invade someone's privacy.

There are other types of solutions to video game addiction. You can store away all gadgets even social media for that matter for two weeks. In the mean time you can exercise with your friend, do stuff together like going to the mall or hiking or even meditation. every single thing that wouldn’t involve you on your computer. </font>
